# Calculator-Extension

This project was created for Knight Hacks on February 15 - April 18, 2023.

This project aims to develop a web extension that can perform various calculations for users, including unit conversions, basic arithmetic operations, and more advanced mathematical functions. This extension will serve as a shortcut on the user's web browser, eliminating the need to physically retrieve a calculator or open another window on their computer.

During the Spring 2023 semester, we created a calculator web extension using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The extension allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, log functions, trig functions, power functions, and factorial functions. Users can access a calculator display directly from their web browser with this extension. The calculator also includes a memory function to store previous results for future calculations. Furthermore, the extension comes in light and dark modes, which can toggle based on user preference.
