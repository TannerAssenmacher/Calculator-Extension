# Calculator-Extension

This project was created for Knight Hacks on February 15 - , 2023.

This project aims to design and create a web extension to perform basic calculations for the user. These calculations include unit conversion, basic arithmetic operations, and more advanced mathematic functionalities. Instead of physically getting a calculator or opening another window on your computer, this will serve as a shortcut on the userâ€™s web browser that will open a calculator.
